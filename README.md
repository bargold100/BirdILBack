## Introduction
Bird Ringing is an important tool that ornithologists use to track the migrating birds by attaching an identifying ring to the bird's leg. 
When a ringed bird is trapped, it allows ornithologists to monitor physiological changes and lifespan, estimate population size, but most interesting of all â€“ identify approximate migration routes by sharing existing knowledge between countries. 

However, ornithologists in Israel were hamstrung by the lack of analytical tools to interpret and analyze the data they had collected over the years. All the data was concentrated at the Israeli Birding Center, inaccessible to researchers and the public. 

## The project
[Bird IL](http://ibra.cs.bgu.ac.il/ "Go to Bird IL") system, which was established in collaboration with the Israeli Bird Ringing Center, is the first geographic information system of its kind in Israel (and maybe in the whole world) that aims to make bird ringing data accessible to researchers and the general public in the format of an updated and easy-to-use website. 

Using a unique algorithm developed as part of the project, the system helps track the migration routes of the birds and identify prominent patterns. In addition, it helps analyzing the ringing and observations data, understanding distribution of bird species, estimating population size and tracking changes that happened to it over time and seasons. 

All of these are displayed on a map using visualization tools that aim to make it easier for the user to draw conclusions and use the system. Moreover, the system was tested by 22 professionals who testified to the simplicity of understanding the system. 

This unique combination of technology and environment will preserve endangered species, encourage the establishment of ecological sites, help identify environmental hazards or climate changes, and may even prevent collisions between birds and aircrafts.  

This way we can cherish our gratitude to nature in an age where technology may pose a threat to it.
